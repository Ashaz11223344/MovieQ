# MovieQ
I created MovieQ to solve a common problem: the overwhelming choice of what to watch. With thousands of movies available across various platforms, it's easy to spend more time browsing than actually watching. MovieQ simplifies this process with intelligent recommendations, detailed information, and an intuitive interface.
